My path to data science wasn't linearâ€¦ My professional journey has been a deliberate exploration of various disciplines. I started my career as an architect, but an interest in business operations and strategy led me to pursue a masters degree in management. From there, I explored the fast-paced world of trading. 

The world of data science has recently captured my attention. A recent data analytics course sparked a particular interest in programming, especially the R language. The ability to combine the precision of statistics with the power and flexibility of coding is what truly intrigued me about data science.

This blog serves as a chronicle of my ongoing exploration into data science, where I share my learnings and experiences in this field.
